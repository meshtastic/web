## Progress Web App Support (PWA)

Meshtastic Web Client now includes Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality,
allowing users to:

- Install the app on desktop and mobile devices
- Access the interface offline
- Receive updates automatically
- Experience faster load times with caching

To install as a PWA:

- On desktop: Look for the install icon in your browser's address bar
- On mobile: Use "Add to Home Screen" option in your browser menu

PWA functionality works with both the hosted version and self-hosted instances.

## Self-host

The client can be self hosted using the precompiled container images with an OCI
compatible runtime such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or
[Podman](https://podman.io/). The base image used is
[Nginx 1.27](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)

```bash
# With Docker
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web

#With Podman
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web
```

## Release Schedule

Our release process follows these guidelines:

- **Versioning:** We use Semantic Versioning (`Major.Minor.Patch`).
- **Stable Releases:** Published around the beginning of each month (e.g.,
  `v2.3.4`).
- **Pre-releases:** A pre-release is typically issued mid-month for testing and
  early adoption.
- **Nightly Builds:** An experimental Docker image containing the latest
  cutting-edge features and fixes is automatically built nightly from the
  `master` branch.

### Nightly Builds

```bash
# With Docker
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web:nightly
#With Podman
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web:nightly
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> - Nightly builds represent the latest development state and may contain
>   breaking changes
> - These builds undergo automated testing but may be less stable than tagged
>   release versions
> - Not recommended for production environments unless you are actively testing
>   new features
> - No guarantee of backward compatibility between nightly builds

#### Version Information

Each nightly build is tagged with:

- The nightly tag for the latest build
- A specific SHA for build reproducibility

### Feedback

If you encounter any issues with nightly builds, please report them in our
[issues tracker](https://github.com/meshtastic/web/issues). Your feedback helps
improve the stability of future releases

## Development & Building

You'll need to download the package manager used with this repo. You can install
it by visiting [deno.com](https://deno.com/) and following the installation
instructions listed on the home page.

### Development

Install the dependencies.

```bash
deno i
```

Start the development server:

```bash
deno task dev
```

### Building and Packaging

Build the project:

```bash
deno task build
```

GZip the output:

```bash
deno task package
```

### Why Deno?

Meshtastic Web uses Deno as its development platform for several compelling
reasons:

- **Built-in Security**: Deno's security-first approach requires explicit
  permissions for file, network, and environment access, reducing vulnerability
  risks.
- **TypeScript Support**: Native TypeScript support without additional
  configuration, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
- **Modern JavaScript**: First-class support for ESM imports, top-level await,
  and other modern JavaScript features.
- **Simplified Tooling**: Built-in formatter, linter, test runner, and bundler
  eliminate the need for multiple third-party tools.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Lockfile ensures consistent builds across all
  environments.
- **Web Standard APIs**: Uses browser-compatible APIs, making code more portable
  between server and client environments.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions! Hereâ€™s how the deployment flow works for pull
requests:

- **Preview Deployments:**\
  Every pull request automatically generates a preview deployment on Vercel.
  This allows you and reviewers to easily preview changes before merging.

- **Staging Environment (`client-test`):**\
  Once your PR is merged, your changes will be available on our staging site:
  [client-test.meshtastic.org](https://client-test.meshtastic.org/).\
  This environment supports rapid feature iteration and testing without
  impacting the production site.

- **Production Releases:**\
  At regular intervals, stable and fully tested releases are promoted to our
  production site: [client.meshtastic.org](https://client.meshtastic.org/).\
  This is the primary interface used by the public to connect with their
  Meshtastic nodes.

better!
