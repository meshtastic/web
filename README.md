## Progress Web App Support (PWA)

Meshtastic Web Client now includes Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality,
allowing users to:

- Install the app on desktop and mobile devices
- Access the interface offline
- Receive updates automatically
- Experience faster load times with caching

To install as a PWA:

- On desktop: Look for the install icon in your browser's address bar
- On mobile: Use "Add to Home Screen" option in your browser menu

PWA functionality works with both the hosted version and self-hosted instances.

## Self-host

The client can be self hosted using the precompiled container images with an OCI
compatible runtime such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or
[Podman](https://podman.io/). The base image used is
[Nginx 1.27](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)

```bash
# With Docker
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web

#With Podman
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web
```

## Nightly releases

Our nightly releases provide the latest development builds with cutting-edge
features and fixes. These builds are automatically generated from the latest
main branch every night and are available for testing and early adoption.

```bash
# With Docker
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web:nightly
#With Podman
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web:nightly
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> - Nightly builds represent the latest development state and may contain
>   breaking changes
> - These builds undergo automated testing but may be less stable than tagged
>   release versions
> - Not recommended for production environments unless you are actively testing
>   new features
> - No guarantee of backward compatibility between nightly builds

### Version Information

Each nightly build is tagged with:

- The nightly tag for the latest build
- A specific SHA for build reproducibility

### Feedback

If you encounter any issues with nightly builds, please report them in our
[issues tracker](https://github.com/meshtastic/web/issues). Your feedback helps
improve the stability of future releases

## Development & Building

You'll need to download the package manager used with this repo. You can install
it by visiting [deno.com](https://deno.com/) and following the installation
instructions listed on the home page.

### Development

Install the dependencies.

```bash
deno install
```

### Install Git Hooks (Optional but highly recommended)

This project uses the npm package `simple-git-hooks` to enforce linting and
formatting before you are allowed to commit. Run the following command once on
your machine after cloning or installing dependencies:

```bash
deno task install-hooks
```

This will install the pre-commit hook that runs `deno task lint:fix` and
`deno task format` before every commit.

### Start the development server:

```bash
deno task dev
```

### Building and Packaging

Build the project:

```bash
deno task build
```

GZip the output:

```bash
deno task package
```

### Why Deno?

Meshtastic Web uses Deno as its development platform for several compelling
reasons:

- **Built-in Security**: Deno's security-first approach requires explicit
  permissions for file, network, and environment access, reducing vulnerability
  risks.
- **TypeScript Support**: Native TypeScript support without additional
  configuration, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
- **Modern JavaScript**: First-class support for ESM imports, top-level await,
  and other modern JavaScript features.
- **Simplified Tooling**: Built-in formatter, linter, test runner, and bundler
  eliminate the need for multiple third-party tools.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Lockfile ensures consistent builds across all
  environments.
- **Web Standard APIs**: Uses browser-compatible APIs, making code more portable
  between server and client environments.

### Debugging

#### Debugging with React Scan

Meshtastic Web Client has included the library
[React Scan](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan) to help you identify and
resolve render performance issues during development.

React's comparison-by-reference approach to props makes it easy to inadvertently
cause unnecessary re-renders, especially with:

- Inline function callbacks (`onClick={() => handleClick()}`)
- Object literals (`style={{ color: "purple" }}`)
- Array literals (`items={[1, 2, 3]}`)

These are recreated on every render, causing child components to re-render even
when nothing has actually changed.

Unlike React DevTools, React Scan specifically focuses on performance
optimization by:

- Clearly distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary renders
- Providing render counts for components
- Highlighting slow-rendering components
- Offering a dedicated performance debugging experience

#### Usage

When experiencing slow renders, run:

```bash
deno task dev:scan
```

This will allow you to discover the following about your components and pages:

- Components with excessive re-renders
- Performance bottlenecks in the render tree
- Expensive hook operations
- Props that change reference on every render

Use these insights to apply targeted optimizations like `React.memo()`,
`useCallback()`, or `useMemo()` where they'll have the most impact.
