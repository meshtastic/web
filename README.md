### Contributing

We welcome contributions! Hereâ€™s how the deployment flow works for pull
requests:

- **Preview Deployments:**\
  Every pull request automatically generates a preview deployment on Vercel.
  This allows you and reviewers to easily preview changes before merging.

- **Staging Environment (`client-test`):**\
  Once your PR is merged, your changes will be available on our staging site:
  [client-test.meshtastic.org](https://client-test.meshtastic.org/).\
  This environment supports rapid feature iteration and testing without
  impacting the production site.

- **Production Releases:**\
  At regular intervals, stable and fully tested releases are promoted to our
  production site: [client.meshtastic.org](https://client.meshtastic.org/).\
  This is the primary interface used by the public to connect with their
  Meshtastic nodes.
