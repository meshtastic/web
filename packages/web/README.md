## Self-host

The client can be self hosted using the precompiled container images with an OCI
compatible runtime such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or
[Podman](https://podman.io/). The base image used is
[Nginx 1.27](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)

```bash
# With Docker
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web

#With Podman
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web
```

## Release Schedule

Our release process follows these guidelines:

- **Versioning:** We use Semantic Versioning (`Major.Minor.Patch`).
- **Stable Releases:** Published around the beginning of each month (e.g.,
  `v2.6.1`).
- **Pre-releases:** A pre-release is typically issued mid-month for testing and
  early adoption.
- **Nightly Builds:** An experimental Docker image containing the latest
  cutting-edge features and fixes is automatically built nightly from the `main`
  branch.

### Nightly Builds

```bash
# With Docker
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web:nightly
#With Podman
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web:nightly
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> - Nightly builds represent the latest development state and may contain
>   breaking changes
> - These builds undergo automated testing but may be less stable than tagged
>   release versions
> - Not recommended for production environments unless you are actively testing
>   new features
> - No guarantee of backward compatibility between nightly builds

#### Version Information

Each nightly build is tagged with:

- The nightly tag for the latest build
- A specific SHA for build reproducibility

### Feedback

If you encounter any issues with nightly builds, please report them in our
[issues tracker](https://github.com/meshtastic/web/issues). Your feedback helps
improve the stability of future releases

## Development & Building

You'll need to download the package manager used with this repo. You can install
it by visiting [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/) and following the installation
instructions listed on the home page.

### Development

Install the dependencies.

```bash
cd packages/web &&
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Building and Packaging

Build the project:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

GZip the output:

```bash
pnpm run package
```

### Why pnpm?

Meshtastic Web uses pnpm as its package manager for several compelling
reasons:

- **Efficient Storage**: pnpm uses content-addressable storage, avoiding duplication
  of packages across projects and saving significant disk space.
- **Fast Performance**: Faster package installation compared to other package
  managers through symlinks and efficient dependency resolution.
- **Strict Dependency Management**: Prevents access to unlisted dependencies,
  ensuring better project reliability and security.
- **Workspace Support**: Excellent monorepo support with workspaces for managing
  multiple packages efficiently.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Lockfile ensures consistent builds across all
  environments.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions! Hereâ€™s how the deployment flow works for pull
requests:

- **Preview Deployments:**\
  Every pull request automatically generates a preview deployment on Vercel.
  This allows you and reviewers to easily preview changes before merging.

- **Staging Environment (`client-test`):**\
  Once your PR is merged, your changes will be available on our staging site:
  [client-test.meshtastic.org](https://client-test.meshtastic.org/).\
  This environment supports rapid feature iteration and testing without
  impacting the production site.

- **Production Releases:**\
  At regular intervals, stable and fully tested releases are promoted to our
  production site: [client.meshtastic.org](https://client.meshtastic.org/).\
  This is the primary interface used by the public to connect with their
  Meshtastic nodes.

better!
