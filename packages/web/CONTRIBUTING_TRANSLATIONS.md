# Contributing Translations

Thank you for your interest in making the Meshtastic Web Client accessible to a
global audience! Your translation efforts are greatly appreciated.

## Our Translation Platform: Crowdin

We manage all our translations through a platform called [Crowdin](https://meshtastic.crowdin.com). This allows for a collaborative and streamlined
translation process. All translation work should be done on our Crowdin project, not directly in the code repository via Pull Requests.

### How to Get Started

1.  **Create a Crowdin Account:** If you don't already have one, sign up for a
    free account on Crowdin.
2.  **Join Our Project:** During the sign up process make sure the dropdown shows "Sign Up For", and the Meshtastic logo is displayed below.
3.  **Request Translator Role:** Once you have an account, join the Meshtastic
    Discord and notify an admin or developer in the `#web` channel. They will grant you the
    necessary permissions to start translating.
4.  **Start Translating:** Once you have your role, you can begin translating the
    source labels into your native language directly on the Crowdin platform.

### Fixing Typos or Incorrect Translations

If you come across a typo or a translation that could be improved, you can suggest changes directly on Crowdin. This is the preferred method for all text corrections.

1.  **Find the String:** Navigate to the language and find the specific text string you wish to correct.
2.  **Suggest an Alternative:** Click on the existing translation. You will see a "Suggestions" area where you can propose your improved version.
3.  **Provide Context (Optional but Recommended):** You can add a comment to the string explaining why your suggestion is better (e.g., "Fixes a grammatical error," or "This term is more common."). This helps reviewers understand and approve the change faster.

### Language Activation

A new language will only be added to the web client and appear in the language picker once its translation is 100% complete on Crowdin. The repository maintainers will handle this process once the milestone is reached.

Thank you for helping us bring Meshtastic to more users around the world!
