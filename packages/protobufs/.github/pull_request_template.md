### New Hardware Model Acceptance Policy

Due to limited availability and ongoing support, new Hardware Models will only be accepted from [Meshtastic Backers and Partners](https://meshtastic.com/). The Meshtastic team reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy.

#### Alternative for Community Contributors

You are welcome to use one of the existing DIY hardware models in your PlatformIO environment and create a pull request in the firmware project. Please note the following conditions:

- The device will **not** be officially supported by the core Meshtastic team.
- The device will **not** appear in the [Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org/) or Github release assets.
- You will be responsible for ongoing maintenance and support.
- Community-contributed / DIY hardware models are considered experimental and will likely have limited or no testing.

#### Getting Official Support

To have your hardware model officially supported and included in the Meshtastic ecosystem, consider becoming a Meshtastic Backer or Partner. Visit [meshtastic.com](https://meshtastic.com/) for more information about partnership opportunities.
