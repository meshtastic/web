# Contributing Translations

Thank you for your interest in making the Meshtastic Web Client accessible to a
global audience! Your translation efforts are greatly appreciated.

## Our Translation Platform: Crowdin

We manage all our translations through a platform called
[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/). This allows for a collaborative and streamlined
translation process. All translation work should be done on our Crowdin project,
not directly in the code repository via Pull Requests.

### How to Get Started

1. **Create a Crowdin Account:** If you don't already have one, sign up for a
   free account on Crowdin.
2. **Join Our Project:** Please ask for a link to our specific Crowdin project
   on the Meshtastic Discord.
3. **Request Translator Role:** Once you have an account, join the Meshtastic
   Discord and notify an admin in the `#web` channel. They will grant you the
   necessary permissions to start translating.
4. **Start Translating:** Once you have your role, you can begin translating the
   source labels into your native language directly on the Crowdin platform.

### Language Activation

A new language will only be added to the web client and appear in the language
picker once its translation is 100% complete on Crowdin. The repository
maintainers will handle this process once the milestone is reached.

Thank you for helping us bring Meshtastic to more users around the world!
